## Practical Church Music

Yesterday, I bought a book because I remembered reading parts of it in a
bookstore months ago and kept thinking about it intermittently ever since.
(At the time, I thought I could find a copy online since the book is the
public domain, but I had no such luck.)

Titled *Practical Church Music*, it was written in 1909 by Edmund Lorenz,
who turned out to have been the president of somewhat nearby Lebanon Valley
College at one time, in addition to the founder of Lorenz Publishing, whose
materials I often encounter as a church musician in 2025. He's hilariously
opinionated, but probably not often wrong. (Tips include how to get choir
practice to start on time, for instance, and the importance of a 5-minute
break during which the basses and the sopranos may have one of those "small
conversations which may lead to so much." How many church choir members did
Lorenz see go on to get married, I wonder?)

I asked the bookseller if he knew of a book from the 1800s with a red
hardback about church choirs, although I couldn't remember the title or
author, and I swear, his hand just immediately shot out to touch the spine,
which happened to be on the shelf next to us.
