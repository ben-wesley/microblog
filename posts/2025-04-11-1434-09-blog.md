Different kinds of school districts to sub at:

- The classroom doors are always locked. The subs do not get a key. (You
don't go to the bathroom during your prep period because you know you'll
have to find someone to let you back into the classroom you're in charge of
for the day.)
- The subs get keys, whether or not there's a strict door-locking policy.
Subs get a coupon for a free cafeteria lunch.
- Every day you show up, they give you a tiny paper bag with handles and a
sticker saying they appreciate you. Inside the bag is a water bottle, a
free cafeteria meal coupon, and a granola bar.

Only today, instead of a good granola bar, it was a Nutrigrain blueberry
bar. Still, it's the thought that counts
