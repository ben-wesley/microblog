Hello, and welcome to my microblog!

With Twitter having gone to crap since it was bought by Elon Musk -- and
given that it just feels a little weird to be posting on Facebook all the
time -- I've set up this webpage where I can theoretically email myself
whatever I want. Then, every four hours, a script will check for new posts
and automatically place them here for your reading enjoyment.
